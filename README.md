<p>A simple movie recommender that recommends top 3 movies out of 30000 movies from dataset based on user rating by using K-nearest neighbor as a root algorithm. </p>
<p>python, django, numpy, pandas,sklearn</p>
<p>I have aslo added Collaborative Filtering feature to it so that if you rate the recommended movies then next time system will recommend another movie on the basis of ratings given by another users of your taste...:)</p>
